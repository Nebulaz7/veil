# Authentication System Refactoring

## Overview of Changes

The authentication system has been refactored from Passport.js to Supabase for both Google and Twitter/X OAuth providers. This document outlines the changes made and provides guidance for using the new authentication system.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Added Supabase Service

- Created `SupabaseService` to handle authentication with Supabase
- Implemented methods for Google and Twitter OAuth
- Added methods for exchanging OAuth codes for sessions
- Added user info retrieval

### 2. Updated Auth Controller

- Replaced Passport.js guards with direct Supabase OAuth calls
- Implemented a unified callback endpoint for all providers
- Added better error handling
- Enhanced JWT token creation with user metadata

### 3. Updated Auth Module

- Removed Passport.js dependencies
- Added Supabase service
- Configured proper module imports

### 4. Environment Variables

- Added Supabase configuration variables
- Added client redirect URL configuration

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Authentication Flow

- Updated login buttons to properly redirect to backend auth endpoints
- Improved client-handler to process tokens and extract user data
- Added JWT parsing and storage of user profile data

### 2. Auth Utilities

- Created a new `auth.ts` utility file with helper functions:
  - `isAuthenticated()`: Check if user is authenticated
  - `getUserProfile()`: Get user profile data
  - `getAuthToken()`: Get the authentication token
  - `logout()`: Log out user and clear storage
  - `parseJwt()`: Parse JWT token data

### 3. Error Handling

- Created new auth-error page for authentication failures
- Added error handling in client-handler
- Improved redirection logic

### 4. Dashboard

- Updated to use the new auth utilities
- Added user profile display
- Added logout functionality

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with X"
2. Frontend redirects to backend auth endpoint (`/auth/google` or `/auth/twitter`)
3. Backend redirects to Supabase OAuth flow
4. User authenticates with the provider
5. Supabase redirects back to our callback URL
6. Backend processes the OAuth code and retrieves user data
7. Backend creates a JWT token and redirects to frontend with the token
8. Frontend stores token and user profile data
9. User is redirected to dashboard

## How to Use the New System

### Backend

1. Set up Supabase project and configure OAuth providers
2. Update environment variables with Supabase credentials
3. The system will handle authentication automatically

### Frontend

```typescript
// Check if user is authenticated
import { isAuthenticated, getUserProfile, logout } from "../utils/auth";

// Get user authentication status
const authenticated = isAuthenticated();

// Get user profile
const profile = getUserProfile();

// Log out user
logout();
```

## Testing the Authentication Flow

1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Go to the Get Started page
3. Click on "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with X"
4. Complete the authentication process
5. You should be redirected to the dashboard with your profile information

## Known Limitations

1. Token refresh is not implemented yet
2. Session management could be improved
3. Role-based authentication is not implemented
